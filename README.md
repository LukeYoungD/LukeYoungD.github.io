Emergence! (Mothership Drone Simulator Roguelite)

Gameplay Guide:
Click "Spawn Collector" to summon a drone to fight and collect resources. Click the green "Mothership" to open the crafting menu. You will automatically be designing the next drone. Make sure you have enough resources for what you want to make. Save and click a slot to assign the drone to. 

Progress through the waves and get better resources (currently you'll die around wave 21)

There is a speedup in the pause menu, don't go past 2x at first lol. 

You can also upgrade your Mothership directly. 

Manage your energy by converting your collected resources into energy with the left Dismantle menu (max 1000).
